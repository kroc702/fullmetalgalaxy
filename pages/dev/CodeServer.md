# Game service implementation
Basically it receive a game event, load corresponding game, run new event, save game, return nothing
and finally broadcast update through channel API to all connected client.

# I18n
Internationalisation on client use GWT mechanism. On server it use a specific code that look user locale to serve
corresponding jsp or messages.
In model package, we had to find an i18n mechanism that work on client and server side. That mechanism is a
re-implementation of GWT.create() on server side: class SharedI18n have a different implementation for server.
This means that during compilation process (cf build.xml) SharedI18n.class is overridden with code from
com/fullmetalgalaxy/server/override/com/fullmetalgalaxy/model/ressources/Shared.java

# Presence management
cf ChannelManager

# Cron tasks
to update:
  * rooms presence
  * games
  * account and forum synchro

# Forum connection
FMG authenticate itself as an administrator to see all users profile. To keep a unique IP address during
synchro task, we have to use a proxy as GAE infrastructure expose a diferent IP address for every http request.

# Web site
Nothing special indeed...
i18n is done by including relevant jsp files.
